Installation
============

To install |project_name|, you need `Python 3`_ and `pip`_ installed. You
can then either
`download it directly
<https://github.com/borgbackup/borg-import/archive/master.zip>`_
or clone it from github_.
Extract the content, open a terminal in its root folder and
execute the following to install it via pip:
:code:`pip install --user -e .`

If you have */home/user/.local/bin/* in your ``PATH`` variable,
you can then start using |project_name|.
